Olist EDA
📖 Overview

Olist EDA is an exploratory data analysis project based on a large Brazilian e-commerce dataset from the platform Olist. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior, delivery performance, order reviews, and identify factors that affect customer satisfaction. The analysis aims to highlight possible pain points in delivery and service quality and suggest data-driven insights for process improvements.

🎯 Project Goals

Understand the structure of orders (customer → order → products)

Analyze delivery times and compare declared vs actual delivery durations

Investigate the impact of delivery delays on customer reviews

Explore factors related to negative feedback or low ratings

Identify potential areas for optimization in the order/delivery process

🛠 Technologies & Tools

Python 3.x

pandas, NumPy, matplotlib / seaborn (or relevant viz libraries)

Jupyter Notebook (or equivalent)

(Optional) PDF / HTML report generation (if you have the exported report)

Git + GitHub for version control and sharing

📂 Files & Structure

olist_eda_notebook.ipynb — main notebook with data cleaning, analysis, visualizations

data/ (optional) — folder containing raw data (if allowed by license) or instructions to download data

report/ — optional folder containing exported report (PDF) or summary results

README.md — this file

Other supporting files / scripts (if any)
🚀 How to Run / Explore

Clone the repository:

git clone (https://github.com/Baxterini/Olist-EDA)


(If data files are included) Unzip / place raw data into data/ folder

Open the notebook olist_eda_notebook.ipynb in Jupyter / VSCode / other IDE

Run the cells from top to bottom — all dependencies should be standard data-analysis libs (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)

(Optional) Export results / report for presentation

✅ What I Learned / Insights (Summary)

How to work with real-world, messy e-commerce data: join tables (orders, reviews, products, delivery times) and build relational pipelines.

Data cleaning, dealing with missing values, transforming timestamps, merging multiple CSVs / tables.

Exploratory analysis: delivery performance vs customer satisfaction, correlations between delays and negative reviews.

Visualization and reporting: presenting findings clearly and coherently (plots, summary tables).

Understanding of business-oriented data analysis: from raw data to actionable insights / hypotheses.

⚠️ Project Status

This is a completed exploratory data analysis project. The code, notebook, and report are ready and publicly available. The data is static (snapshot), so no further live updates.

📎 Notes & Licensing
